# Dashboard for AI Datathon Competition 2024 by KORIKA

## Dashboard Title and Description
The title of this dashboard is **IK DBD Dashboard** (Dashboard Indeks Kerentanan Penyakit Demam Berdarah Dengue (DBD))

The IK DBD dashboard is a dashboard for mapping the level of vulnerability to dengue fever that occurs in Indonesian society. Currently, the dashboard is still only focused on mapping the level of vulnerability in Java island. Increasing resilience or reducing vulnerability to dengue fever can be an effort to reduce the impact of dengue virus infection at all levels (Hagenlocher et al., 2013; Hanifah Septiani et al., 2021). The existence of climate change as a global phenomenon has a number of impacts, such as decreased ability to grow food, difficulties in the housing, safety and employment sectors, to climate change being able to affect human health (Susilawati, 2021), one of which is the spread of infectious diseases. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) which continues to develop can be used as an innovative method in solving problems, including in efforts to prevent and control dengue fever.
